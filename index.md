## Hello, Satyaban Sahoo here.

Contrary to popular belief, math has always been a sphere of comfort, a trainer, and a tour guide in my life. It led me to explore logical thinking and strategy, led me to programming languages, let me explore data science, and assisted me in inculcating practical learning. Owing to my experiences, I have been a tutor and a freelancer, and I choose to continue my exploration. Exploring more brings me to the interest in data science and analysis.
